## Greetings
Hello. This is my first plugin, take a look tell me it's bad if it is ðŸ˜‰.

### /tempfly command
Make sure to note that /tempfly command is not intended for giving players temporary access to the /fly command, instead,
it's for giving fly to players (who don't have access to /fly command) for a brief amount of time.

### Placeholders
* **%lightfly_flymode%** - Returns whether player has fly active or not.
* **%lightfly_flymode_\<player>%** - Returns whether \<player> has fly active or not.


* **%lightfly_isflying%** - Returns true if player is currently flying, false if otherwise.
* **%lightfly_isflying_\<player>%** - Returns true if \<player> is currently flying, false if otherwise.


* **%lightfly_tempfly_time%** - Shows the remaining temp fly time (returns 0 if player doesn't have tempfly active)
* **%lightfly_tempfly_time_\<player>%** - Shows the remaining temp fly time of \<player>.
